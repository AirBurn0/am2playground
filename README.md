Public repository for AM2PlayGround (Ars Magica 2 1.7.10 addon) resources: localization, addon issues reports and suggestions

## What it is?

AM2PlayGround, or AM2PG for short, is a quick-made Ars Magica 2 Addon, as far as I know, fisrt of any among its own (Ima adding spell components, dude. New spell components!) (except [this](https://github.com/Mithion/APIDemoMod) thing; This is made along before I made my own, but as far as you can see - it has no use)

### Main and only goal of this addon:
* Make AM2 expirience more funny, arcane, long and less torture.

## What it does?
It adds new spell shapes, components, modifiers, some talents, rebalances mechanics (like Clarity - it was broken as hell, for sure. But don't worry, it's still can be used as a 0 mana cost exploit), adding new items and recipes, bring some compatability and integration with my other favorite mods and a lots of other staff that I'm stupidly forget to mention there (or there was some purpose for it not to be mentioned ðŸ˜‰)

## What is this repository for?
This repository, once again, is used for community contributing localization, creating issues and suggestions.

Although the license below forbids you to create your work based on mine (because I simply donâ€™t see the point in this - just ask me to do it, and if I ever abandon the project, I will just change the license so you will allowed to), creating new localization files (.lang) and textures is not derived from my work (if it is, consider that you have rights to it), and generally very welcome.

## Other FAQ
### <b>Q</b>: Where is the source-code? Is the project not open-source?

  <b>A</b>: The fact is that I messed up the code a lot, and without refactoring it seems unreadable and even can offend someone (I shouldn't have added jokes to the code). When I'm done with the refactoring, I'll release the project's source code to this repository. But until then, the project is not open source. You can still decompile the sources at your own risk (to see the code that even worse than in original AM2 repo) if you're interested.
  
### <b>Q</b>: Is it compatible with other AM2 forks like [TCLProject](https://github.com/TCLProject/ArsMagica2-5) or [ToCraft](https://github.com/ToCraft/ArsMagica2) ones?

  <b>A</b>: I designed the addon in such a way that it is compatible with almost every version of AM2 I know for this moment. And as far as I know, it is. But since I'n developing my addon based on Mithion's original work, there may be bugs with other versions, and their reporting is appreciated.
### <b>Q</b>: With which mods there is an iteration?

  <b>A</b>: For now, it's Thaumcraft and Baubles (by Azanor), Thaumic Tinkerer (by Pixlepix), Forbidden Magic (by SpitefulFox), Blood Magic (by WayofTime), Botania (by Vazkii), Aether-Legacy (by The-Aether-Team), Traveller's Gear (by BluSunrize). Some of compatabilities is more global, like Thaumcraft one, some - less, like Aether one. I'm currently planning Tinker's Construct and Avaritia integration, and maybe more Botania stuff.
### <b>Q</b>: Can you make an integration for X?

  <b>A</b>: As long as it's not an Alfheim, and mod is intresting enough - sure. There is one problem tho - if I haven't integrated with X yet, and didn't plan to, then I simply don't know about the existence of this mod, or about what specific content needs to be added so that playing with AM2 and X can be more fun.
### <b>Q</b>: I have a localization file/bug report/idea to suggest, what must I do?

  <b>A</b>:

  If it's localization file, fork this project, do some git magic, make pull request with localization file added.

  If it's bug report - make a new issue with detailed info provided: crash log, situation conditions (that I can actually reprthe faces of your friendsoduce bug by myself, debug and finally fix it) and some additional info like screenshots will not be superfluous.

  If it's idea suggestion - create a new issue with detailed information about what do you want me to add (what's it, how it must work, etc.), and why must I actually spent my time doing it instead of adding something else. Resources like models and textures if you wanted something complex is appreciated as well.
  
  If you are to young for github or your intentions cannot be carried out with it, contact me in a way that is accessible to you (I have some social networks but you must figure them out by yourself).
### <b>Q</b>: Is it gameplay-balanced?

  <b>A</b>: No.
### <b>Q</b>: Did you think twice before making this addon?

  <b>A</b>: Think twice? Man, I don't even think once.
### <b>Q</b>: Can I use it on my server?

  <b>A</b>: Okay, listen here: at the bottom, is the license, and it clearly says that you cannot earn income with my addon, and also you cannot recompile its sources to suit your needs, and this means that <b>IF</b> you start a public server with some commercial targets or even donation function, only answer that I can give you is <b>NO</b>. But if you just open a local server to throw some Random Damage spell at faces of your friends - well, I won't know about it anyway.
### <b>Q</b>: Can I use it in my modpack?

  <b>A</b>: Yeah, feel free. Unless, of course, you are going to run it on a server with commercial purposes.
### <b>Q</b>: Are there any bugs?

  <b>A</b>: Yeah, lots of them, exactly like in any other mod, if not more. It's no secret that AM2 is buggy as hell, and in general... I'm fine with it.
  Most of the bugs like chronodispel or more funny ones like 42 prosperity spell, for me now it's more of a gameplay feature than anything else.
  Dupes with a book and other bugs that obviously kill interest in the game are not, but what does not work well in AM2 - most likely does not work well in addon either, becouse of AM2 API and my <b>skill issue</b>.

  But btw, I fixed some of AM2 built-in bugs (you will never figure out which ones, for sure).
### <b>Q</b>: Will you port it on newer minecraft versions?

  <b>A</b>: To date, a relatively stable and canon version of AM2 exists only on 1.7.10. AM2 1.10.2 - not canon and WAAAAAY more bugged than AM2 on 1.7.10 version. It's just unplayable for me. There is Ars Magica Legacy on 1.18.0 minecraft version and above, but so far it's still even worse than on 1.10.2 version. So technically, I just have nowhere to port the addon, and my answer is NO, untill they make it playable enough.
### <b>Q</b>: What is your favorite Minecraft 1.7.10 magic mod?

  <b>A</b>: Ars Magica 2. I guess it was obvious.
### <b>Q</b>: Can you add more Warframe Lavos reference?

  <b>A</b>: Ce'nos, again, my final answer is:
### no
